This website (Github Repository) lists the documents associated with the Galt's Gulch Chile Project.

### Article I : General Guidelines

The "GGC Voluntary Home Owners Association" is operated under the belief that voluntarism, innovation and responsibility are the best principles to guide our community. In order to realize these ideals we seek to establish market prices for services and opt in / opt out based mechanisms to enable people to interact in a voluntary and peaceful manner. This document is intended to illustrate an outline of intentions and goals in terms of home owners’ association guidelines. 

### VHOA Framework:

1. Individual residents will choose a voluntary home owners association.

2. Individual residents have the ability to opt into the VHOA of their choice.

3. Individual residents have the ability to opt out of the VHOA of their choice.

4. Individual residents have the ability to create new VHOA's with different services, rights and responsibilities.

### Resolution of Desputes:

Galt's Gulch Chile is being built on a foundation of individual property rights. To ensure the prosperity of a property rights driven community, and an abundant future, potential conflicts between individuals and service providers will be resolved by voluntary arbitration means.

### VHOA Fees:

VHOA fees will be based on the services the members of the VHOA opt into and out of. 

### Services Competition:

Utilities and services can be offered by GGC company such as water, power and waste management and other businesses / individuals are encouranged and invited to compete in the open market and offer the same, similar or different services to the residents of Gult's Gulch Chile.
