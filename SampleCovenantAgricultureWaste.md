Covenant Rules/ Guidelines Related to Agriculture and Waste Management Organic Version:

1.	GGC is committed to 100% organic agriculture and a complete ban on GMO seeds and chemical pesticides/herbicides. All seeds, plants and organisms raised in the community need to be certified organic or sourced from the GGC farm store directly. 

2.	There will be no rule forcing everyone to compost their food scraps and yard waste. However, GGC will offer composting systems and free collection of compostable materials for all residents, which will augment our fertility investments on GGC farm operations. 

3.	No on-site garbage stock-piling, burning or burying will be allowed by any resident. Published schedules of pickup service will be available. Garbage and recycling cannot be left out on the street except on the day of scheduled pickup. 

4.	Grazing, compost production and animal husbandry will be encouraged and facilitated throughout GGC owned property and residential lots. However, these activities will need reasonable restrictions and limitations to prevent disturbance of neighboring properties. Agricultural activities often mean temporary side-effects such as odors and noises commonly associated with farming and other attributes of a working landscape. On-site compost production shall be limited to household food/yard waste and bio-solids from approved live-stock raised on site. Compost production must either be contained in an approved aerated/odor-filtered housing or produced no closer than 100 meters from any adjacent property. Livestock limitations per .5 hectare of residential property are as follows:

a.	Two cattle or dairy cows; 6 sheep/goats/llamas; 12 chickens; 1 rooster; 2 horses

b.	Any infraction of these limitations will result in a warning with 30 days to remedy, followed by forced sale of the number of animals held on the property in excess of limits, if mediation finds the resident negligent of the rules.
